Find recipes, save them for later or create your weekly menus and know what products to buy at the grocery shop

Please be aware this is my first app created with Flutter and Firebase, it will be having different phases, the first is going to be the MVP and then every slide will be worked on very carefuly in more detail.


If you want to give me feedback you're welcome, also you're welcome to give me more ideas on features to be implemented, I also accept constructive critcs such as the way I'm doing my coding and how I can clean it and organize it better.


In the end, with this app you'll be able, to see several recipes, filter for type of kitchen such as latino, european, mediterranean, etc.

Also you'll be able to like it as your favorite and save it so you can create your weekly menus and calculate what grocery you have to buy every week or month.


In the registration process you'll be asked a couple of questions so the robot can better understand what do you like and can make recomendations and show you only the food that you might like.


Please notice I'm making this app for the sake of practicing my skills your help will be very appreciated.


Enjoy my app!!
